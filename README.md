# Runway

> *In GTD, the "Runway" is where you are right now — the ground level of next actions,
> the things you can actually do today. Before you can reach altitude, you need a clear runway.*

Self-hosted GTD web app built on [Taskwarrior](https://taskwarrior.org/) v3.
Multi-user, mobile-friendly, dark mode. Built by [Agentic Reach](https://agenticreach.com).

---

## Features

- **GTD views** — Inbox, Next Actions, Waiting For, Someday/Maybe, Projects, All Tasks
- **Urgency scoring** via Taskwarrior's algorithm, displayed on every task
- **In Progress** — start/pause tasks with visual highlighting and automatic re-sorting
- **Natural Planning** — 5-step GTD project planning (Purpose → Vision → Brainstorm → Organize → Actions)
- **Projects** — create and plan projects independently of tasks
- **Full task attributes** — priority, due/scheduled/wait/until dates, tags, recurrence, dependencies, annotations
- **Agent-ready** — REST API + MCP server for LLM and automation integration
- Swipe gestures, search/filter, dark mode, per-user data isolation

## Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Backend | Python 3.12 · FastAPI · aiosqlite |
| Frontend | Vue 3 · Vite · Tailwind CSS · Pinia |
| Task engine | Taskwarrior 3.x (TaskChampion / SQLite) |
| Auth | JWT · bcrypt · per-user API keys |
| Deploy | Docker Compose |

## Getting started

**Prerequisites:** Docker and Docker Compose on a Linux host.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ulrichschinz/runway.git
cd runway

cp .env.example .env
# Set JWT_SECRET to a long random string:
#   openssl rand -base64 48
```

`.env`:
```env
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-here
ALLOW_REGISTRATION=true
PORT=4000
```

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

The app is available at `http://your-host:4000`.
The API is available at `http://your-host:8000`.

Register your first user at the login page (set `ALLOW_REGISTRATION=false` afterwards to lock it down).

## Data persistence

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `./data/<username>/` | Per-user Taskwarrior data (`taskchampion.sqlite3`) |
| `./users.db` | Users, API keys, projects (SQLite) |

Both are bind-mounted and excluded from git. Back them up to retain all data.

## Authentication

Runway supports two authentication methods, accepted by all API endpoints:

**JWT** — obtained via `POST /api/auth/login`, valid for 24 hours:
```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

**API key** — permanent, per-user, managed in the app settings:
```
X-Api-Key: <key>
```

API keys are ideal for agents and automations. Each user can view and rotate their key via `GET /api/auth/apikey` and `POST /api/auth/apikey/regenerate`.

## Agent & automation integration

### Inbox endpoint

Any agent can add a task to a user's inbox without a login flow:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-host/api/inbox \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <api-key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"description": "Follow up on proposal", "priority": "H"}'
```

The task lands in that user's GTD inbox, ready for processing.

### MCP server

Runway exposes a full [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server at `/mcp`.
This allows any MCP-compatible client (Claude Desktop, Claude Code, custom agents) to manage tasks directly.

**Claude Desktop** — add to `claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "runway": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "https://your-host/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "X-Api-Key": "<your-api-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Claude Code** — add to `.mcp.json` in your project:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "runway": {
      "type": "sse",
      "url": "https://your-host/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "X-Api-Key": "<your-api-key>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Available MCP tools mirror the REST API: `list_tasks`, `create_task`, `start_task`, `complete_task`, `gtd_inbox`, `list_projects`, `add_to_inbox`, and more.

## Development

```bash
# Rebuild and restart a single service after code changes
docker compose build backend && docker compose up -d backend
docker compose build frontend && docker compose up -d frontend

# View logs
docker compose logs -f backend
```

The backend runs on uvicorn (port 8000). The frontend is built with Vite and served by nginx on port 4000, with `/api/` proxied to the backend.

> **Note:** Docker Compose is configured with `network_mode: host`, which requires a Linux host. Mac and Windows users would need to adjust port mappings in `docker-compose.yml`.
